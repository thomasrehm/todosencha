## Implementation

How was the app created? Anything worth sharing about the process of creating the app? Any spec violations?
To implement the TodoMVC application with Sencha Touch Framework the author of this implementation needed to change a lot of Sencha Touch's provided styling.
In order to making it work like TodoMVC is supposed to work, the author had to *misuse* the framework.
This means the framework was not used like it is intended to. The biggest changes were made in order to style the application like it should look.
